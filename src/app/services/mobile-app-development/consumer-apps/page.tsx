		challenge:
			'Consumer apps compete in environments where users have high expectations and low patience. A slow launch screen, a confusing onboarding flow, or inconsistent performance causes immediate uninstalls. App Store ranking algorithms favour engagement metrics — retention, session length, reviews — over download volume. Businesses building consumer apps often underestimate the product design work required to achieve sustainable user engagement and the ongoing effort needed to maintain app store position after launch.',
		challengePoints: [
			'App designed without a clear retention strategy, resulting in downloads that do not translate to active users',
			'Launch timing without an ASO strategy, so the app is invisible in App Store and Play Store search',
			"Poor onboarding flow losing users before they understand the app's core value",
			'No analytics instrumentation, so post-launch decisions about what to improve are based on guesswork',

	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'What is the difference between a consumer app and an enterprise app?',
			a: 'Consumer apps are distributed through the public App Store and Google Play to end users — they compete for attention, need to be discovered, and succeed or fail based on user engagement metrics. Enterprise apps are typically distributed through MDM to a known employee population, where adoption is driven by business mandate rather than voluntary choice. The design, distribution, and success metrics are fundamentally different.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How important is App Store Optimisation at launch?',
			a: 'It matters significantly for organic discoverability. Apps in competitive categories with no ASO strategy are effectively invisible in search. ASO covers keyword research for app title and description, screenshot design that converts browsers to downloaders, preview video where relevant, and ongoing testing of listing elements. We treat ASO as part of the launch deliverable, not an optional extra.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How do you measure app success after launch?',
			a: 'The primary metrics for consumer apps are D1, D7, and D30 retention rates — what percentage of users who downloaded the app are still using it after 1, 7, and 30 days. We also track session length, key action completion rates, push notification opt-in and engagement rates, and app store rating trajectory. We configure dashboards for these from day one so you have the data to make informed iteration decisions.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Do you offer app marketing services alongside development?',
			a: 'Development and marketing are separate disciplines. We build the app and implement the analytics and notification infrastructure that marketing activity will use. For user acquisition campaigns, ASO, and influencer strategy, we work with specialist app marketing partners or your existing marketing team.',
