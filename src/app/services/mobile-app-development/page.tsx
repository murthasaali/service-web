      "We develop custom mobile applications for business workflows and customer-facing interactions. When you engage us, you receive a version-controlled git repository, a configured mobile app distribution pipeline via TestFlight and Firebase, direct integration with Sentry or Firebase Crashlytics, and completed App Store and Google Play privacy label declarations. Every application is built natively or using React Native or Flutter based on concrete technical requirements, not generic boilerplate templates. This allows us to deliver booking applications with integrated payment processing, technician field apps that sync coordinates and job status, customer self-service billing portals, and inventory tracking apps that interface with mobile barcode scanners — each built to the operational spec of the business it serves.",
