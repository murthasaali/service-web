		challenge:
			'Mobile apps are only as reliable and capable as their backend infrastructure. APIs without proper authentication expose data to anyone who can inspect network traffic. Push notification delivery rates below 50 percent undermine retention strategies. Payment integrations built on deprecated SDKs break in the middle of checkout flows. Backend systems designed for a hundred users fail under a thousand. These problems are preventable with correct architecture at the build stage.',

	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'Should we build our own backend or use a backend-as-a-service platform like Firebase?',
			a: 'Firebase and similar BaaS platforms are a good fit for apps with standard data models and real-time sync requirements where the development cost savings outweigh the vendor dependency and limited customisation. A custom backend is the right choice when you have complex business logic, need deep integration with existing systems, have specific compliance requirements, or will eventually need to move away from per-operation pricing at scale. We assess both options during scoping based on your specific requirements.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How do you implement push notifications that achieve high delivery rates?',
			a: 'The primary causes of low delivery rates are stale device tokens, incorrect APNs certificate or key configuration, sending to unregistered tokens without removing them, and not handling background delivery state correctly on iOS. We implement proper token lifecycle management, configure delivery receipts to detect and remove invalid tokens, and test delivery across app states — foreground, background, and terminated — before launch.',
		},
		{
			q: 'What is the right approach for in-app subscriptions versus payment through our own billing system?',
			a: 'Apps distributed through the App Store and Google Play that sell digital content or subscriptions are required by Apple and Google to use their in-app purchase system, with Apple taking 15 to 30 percent of revenue. For physical goods, services delivered outside the app, or B2B SaaS products, in-app purchase is not required and direct payment via Stripe is more economical. The rules have nuances, and we review your specific product type during scoping to confirm the right approach.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How do you handle API versioning for a mobile app with users on older versions?',
			a: 'Mobile apps cannot force users to update immediately the way web apps can. We implement API versioning from the start so older app versions continue to work after API changes. We maintain old API versions until the percentage of users on affected app versions drops below a threshold, then deprecate with advance notice in app update release notes.',
