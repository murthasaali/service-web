			'Building and maintaining separate iOS and Android codebases doubles the development and ongoing maintenance cost for most standard mobile applications. Features are built twice.

	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'What is the difference between Flutter and React Native?',
			a: 'Flutter uses Dart and renders its own UI using a custom rendering engine (Skia/Impeller), which gives it highly consistent visual output across platforms and very good performance. React Native uses JavaScript or TypeScript and renders through native platform components, which means it more closely follows platform UI conventions but has historically had more performance edge cases. Both are production-ready choices. We typically recommend Flutter for greenfield projects and React Native when a team has existing React or JavaScript expertise.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Can cross-platform apps access all device features?',
			a: 'Almost all device features are accessible through the plugin ecosystem for Flutter and React Native. Camera, location, push notifications, biometric authentication, file system access, Bluetooth, and many others are well-supported. Cutting-edge or very platform-specific features may require writing a native module, which adds cost but is entirely possible within a cross-platform project structure.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How does performance compare to native apps?',
			a: 'For the vast majority of mobile applications — forms, data display, navigation, animations, and standard UI interactions — cross-platform frameworks produce performance indistinguishable from native to users. The cases where native has a measurable advantage are high-frame-rate real-time graphics, intensive AR processing, and very low-level audio or sensor work. We assess whether your requirements fall into these categories during scoping.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How do you handle platform-specific design differences between iOS and Android?',
			a: "iOS and Android have different navigation paradigms, typography scales, and interaction conventions. We implement platform-specific adaptations for navigation patterns, icon styles, and interaction conventions where the experience genuinely benefits from following each platform's guidelines. We scope these adaptations explicitly so you understand what differs between the two platforms before development begins.",
