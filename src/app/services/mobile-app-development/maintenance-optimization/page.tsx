	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'How often do mobile apps typically need maintenance updates?',
			a: 'At minimum, most apps require updates twice a year to address iOS and Android major release compatibility before the new operating systems ship in autumn. Apps with active user bases and changing business requirements typically release updates monthly or more frequently. Apps that are launched and then unmaintained for more than 12 months will usually encounter at least one significant compatibility or compliance issue that requires attention.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How do you prioritise bugs when there is a long backlog?',
			a: 'We use a priority classification based on impact (how many users are affected), severity (crash versus inconvenience), and breadcrumb trail (is the bug related to a known root cause that fixing will resolve multiple reports). Crashes on frequently used flows get priority regardless of report volume. Issues affecting only very old device versions or edge case configurations are lower priority.',
		},
		{
			q: 'What is involved in an iOS major release compatibility review?',
			a: "We install the new iOS beta on test devices, run through the full application test plan covering all key flows, and review Apple's release notes for deprecated APIs the app currently uses. Findings are categorised by urgency — critical (affects launch or key flows), important (affects secondary features), and informational (future deprecation notice). We submit a fix update before the public iOS release date.",
		},
		{
			q: 'Can you maintain an app that was built by a different development team?',
			a: 'Yes, though we start every inherited app with a codebase review to understand the structure, identify existing technical debt, and assess the quality of the test coverage. This gives us a realistic picture of the maintenance effort before committing to specific timelines. We document our findings and agree on a remediation approach for any significant structural issues that would affect ongoing maintenance efficiency.',
		},
	],
	answerSummary:
		'UK and India app owners whose launched applications gradually become unreliable due to OS updates and performance degradation get structured maintenance programmes covering OS compatibility testing, bug triage, performance profiling, and compliance monitoring to keep apps current.',
