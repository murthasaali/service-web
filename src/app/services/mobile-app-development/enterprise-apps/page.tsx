    challenge:
      "Enterprise mobile applications fail when they are built as generic consumer-style apps applied to internal business workflows. Field technicians using an app that does not match how their work actually flows abandon it within weeks. Employee-facing apps that require connectivity lose utility the moment a field worker goes out of range. Internal apps with poor MDM integration cannot be deployed or updated centrally, creating version fragmentation across device fleets.",
    challengePoints: [
      "Field workforce using paper forms or spreadsheets because the existing app does not match their workflow",
      "Internal apps without offline capability that are unusable in locations without reliable connectivity",
      "No MDM integration, so apps cannot be deployed, updated, or remotely managed centrally",
      "Enterprise systems integration absent, so field workers re-enter data already in another system"
    ],
    solution:
      "We build enterprise mobile applications around the specific workflows they need to support, with offline capability, enterprise system integrations, and MDM-compatible deployment. The application is designed from field research into how the work actually happens, not from assumptions about what the workflow should be.",

      "Workflow design based on how the role actually operates, not an assumed idealised process",

  faqs: [
    { q: "How do you design an enterprise app that field workers will actually use?", a: "Field worker apps fail most often because they were designed by office-based staff making assumptions about the workflow rather than observing it. We start every enterprise app project with field research — going to the worksite, watching the workflow, understanding the connectivity constraints, the device types, and the environmental conditions. The app is designed around what we observe, not what is assumed." },
    { q: "What does offline-first mean in practice?", a: "An offline-first app stores data locally on the device and queues all write operations when offline. When connectivity is restored, it syncs pending changes to the backend, handling any conflicts between local and server state. The user experience is uninterrupted regardless of connectivity — they complete their work in the app, and the sync happens in the background." },
    { q: "Can enterprise apps integrate with our SAP or Oracle system?", a: "Yes, though the complexity depends on which system and what integration is required. SAP and Oracle expose APIs that most integration scenarios can use. Some older enterprise systems expose data through file exports or scheduled jobs rather than real-time APIs, which requires a different integration pattern. We assess the integration approach based on what your system actually supports." },
    { q: "How are enterprise apps distributed to employees?", a: "Enterprise apps are typically distributed through an MDM platform — Microsoft Intune, Jamf, or VMware Workspace ONE — rather than the public app stores. This allows IT to push the app to enrolled devices, manage updates centrally, and revoke access when an employee leaves. We configure the app for MDM-compatible deployment as part of the build." },
