    challenge:
      "Most businesses have more historical data than they can interpret. Operations generate logs, transaction records, customer behaviour data, and support history, but the insights stay buried because the tools used to view them only show what already happened.

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "What data do you need to build a predictive model?",
      a: "The most useful input is structured historical data with clear labels or outcomes, such as customer transaction records with churn flags, or demand history with dates and quantities. You typically need at least 12 months of history and enough positive examples of the outcome you want to predict. We run a data assessment before starting to confirm whether the available data is sufficient.",
    },
    {
      q: "How accurate are the predictions typically?",
      a: "Accuracy depends heavily on data quality, the volume of historical data, and how stable the patterns are over time. For churn prediction with clean data, models typically achieve 75 to 90 percent accuracy. We provide confidence intervals and benchmarks during the scoping phase so you have realistic expectations before build begins.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you deliver the model as code we can run ourselves, or as a hosted service?",
      a: "We can deliver either. If you have a data engineering team, we provide the trained model code, training scripts, and inference API. If you want a managed solution, we deploy the model to a cloud endpoint and handle retraining on a schedule.",
    },
    {
      q: "How often do models need to be retrained?",
      a: "It depends on how quickly the underlying patterns change. Demand forecasting models in stable businesses may only need quarterly retraining. Churn models in rapidly evolving markets may need monthly updates. We build retraining pipelines so the process can run on a schedule with minimal manual intervention.",
