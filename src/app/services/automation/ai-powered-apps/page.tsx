    challenge:
      "Many businesses want to add AI to their product but treat it as a feature layer on top of existing architecture. This leads to fragile integrations, inconsistent user experience, and AI capabilities that do not actually change how the product works. The result is an AI button rather than an AI product.",
    challengePoints: [
      "AI added as a feature after the product was designed without it in the architecture",
      "Slow, unreliable inference because the AI layer is not properly integrated into the stack",
      "No mechanism to collect user feedback and improve model performance over time",
      "Difficulty knowing whether the AI is actually working correctly in production",
    ],

      "We design applications with AI at the functional core, where the model drives the experience rather than supplementing it. The architecture accounts for inference latency, output variability, model versioning, and feedback loops from the start rather than as afterthoughts.",

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Can AI capabilities be added to our existing application?",
      a: "Yes. We assess your current application architecture and design an integration approach that adds AI capabilities cleanly without requiring a full rebuild. This typically involves adding an API layer, designing the inference call pattern, handling latency and error states in the UI, and implementing feedback collection.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you build custom models or use existing foundation models like GPT or Claude?",
      a: "Both, depending on what the use case requires. Most business applications are best served by prompting or fine-tuning a foundation model rather than training from scratch, which would require far more data and compute. We use foundation models as the base and apply fine-tuning, RAG, or structured prompting depending on the accuracy and performance needs.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do you handle AI errors or incorrect outputs in production?",
      a: "We build explicit error handling into the application for AI outputs, including confidence thresholds, fallback responses when inference fails, and UI patterns that communicate uncertainty to users rather than presenting AI output as definitive. High-stakes outputs include a review step before they reach end users.",
    },
    {
      q: "What does monitoring look like after the app is deployed?",
      a: "We instrument AI endpoints with latency metrics, error rates, output quality samples, and usage volumes. Alerts fire when latency degrades or error rates rise above baseline. We also configure drift detection to flag when model outputs are deviating from expected patterns, which typically indicates the data the model was trained on no longer reflects real-world inputs.",
