		challenge:
			'Most businesses have analytics installed but do not have analytics that work. Tracking is misconfigured, conversions are not set up, and the data in dashboards does not match the numbers from other systems. Decision-making defaults back to gut instinct because no one trusts the data. Meanwhile, conversion leaks in the funnel go unidentified because no one has a clear picture of where users are dropping off.',
		challengePoints: [
			'Analytics data not matching CRM or sales data because tracking is misconfigured',
			'Conversion events not set up, so there is no reliable data on what marketing activity is driving results',

			'Marketing decisions based on activity metrics like clicks and sessions rather than outcome metrics',

		solution:
			'We audit your analytics implementation, fix tracking gaps, and build the reporting layer that connects marketing activity to business outcomes. Then we use that data to run conversion optimisation — identifying the points in your funnel where improvement has the most impact and testing changes systematically.',

	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'Why does our GA4 data not match our Shopify or CRM numbers?',
			a: 'This is one of the most common analytics problems we encounter. Typical causes include ad blockers preventing GA4 from firing on some sessions, tag misconfiguration causing duplicate events, or a mismatch in how GA4 and your platform define a completed transaction. We run a systematic audit to identify the specific cause in your setup and document the expected discrepancy after fixes are applied — some level of variance between GA4 and server-side data is normal and expected.',
		},
		{
			q: 'What is the difference between conversion rate optimisation and A/B testing?',
			a: 'CRO is the overall discipline of systematically improving the percentage of users who complete a desired action. A/B testing is one tool within CRO — it compares two versions of a page or element with real traffic to determine which performs better with statistical confidence. CRO also includes heatmap and session recording analysis, user research, and qualitative insight gathering before and after tests.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How long does an analytics audit take?',
			a: 'A standard GA4 and Tag Manager audit for a business website takes one to two weeks. This covers event tracking completeness, conversion configuration, data layer implementation, cross-domain tracking if relevant, and a documented findings report with prioritised fixes.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Do we need to rebuild our analytics from scratch or can existing data be preserved?',
			a: 'Usually both are possible. For GA4, we prefer to fix the existing property rather than start fresh, so historical data is preserved. Where the existing implementation is too broken to repair efficiently, we set up a parallel clean property and document the transition date so historical and new data are clearly separated.',
