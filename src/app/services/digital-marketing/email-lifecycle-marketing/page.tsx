	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'Which email platform do you recommend?',
			a: 'For e-commerce, Klaviyo is the strongest choice due to deep Shopify and WooCommerce integration and revenue attribution. For B2B businesses, HubSpot or ActiveCampaign offer better CRM integration and sales handoff workflows. Mailchimp is a cost-effective option for simpler needs. We recommend based on your existing tech stack and the complexity of automation you need.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How many emails should a lead nurturing sequence have?',
			a: 'That depends on how long your typical buying process takes. B2B services with a three to six month sales cycle benefit from a 90-day sequence with 8 to 12 emails. E-commerce businesses converting in days need much shorter, higher-urgency sequences. We design sequence length based on your actual conversion data, not arbitrary best practice numbers.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Can you migrate our existing email lists without deliverability issues?',
			a: 'Yes, with care. Migrating a cold or aged list to a new platform requires a warm-up process to establish sender reputation. We handle domain authentication (DKIM, SPF, DMARC), list cleaning to remove invalid addresses, and a staged sending plan to build deliverability before sending to the full list.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How do you measure the success of lifecycle automations?',
			a: 'We track open rate, click rate, and conversion rate per automation step, plus the primary business metric each automation is designed to move — trial-to-paid conversion for an onboarding sequence, repeat purchase rate for a retention flow, recovery rate for a win-back campaign. We include these in monthly reports alongside recommendations for improving underperforming steps.',
