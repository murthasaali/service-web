	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'Which social platforms should we be active on?',
			a: 'That depends on where your audience actually spends time and what you are trying to achieve. B2B professional services typically prioritise LinkedIn. Consumer brands with visual products prioritise Instagram and TikTok. Local service businesses benefit from consistent Facebook and Google Business activity. Being mediocre on five platforms is worse than being strong on two. We recommend a platform mix during strategy development based on your audience and objectives.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How often should we be posting?',
			a: 'Consistency matters more than frequency for most business accounts. Three to five posts per week on the primary platform is usually a better foundation than attempting daily posts and dropping to one per week when the team is busy. We set a posting cadence that is sustainable based on your content production resources.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How do you measure social media ROI?',
			a: 'We use a combination of platform metrics (reach, engagement) and downstream attribution (referral traffic from social, leads with social last-touch attribution, revenue from social-sourced contacts in the CRM). We are transparent about what is and is not attributable, since some brand-building value from social is real but not directly trackable to a conversion.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Do you manage influencer relationships directly?',
			a: 'Yes. We handle influencer identification, outreach, negotiation, briefing, content review, and performance reporting. You approve the influencer shortlist and content brief before anything is confirmed. We recommend influencers based on audience quality metrics, not follower count — engagement rate and audience fit matter more than size.',
		},
	],
	answerSummary:
		'UK and India businesses with inconsistent social media presence and no link between activity and outcomes get content calendars, creative production, community management, and reporting that connects social activity to traffic, leads, or revenue.',
