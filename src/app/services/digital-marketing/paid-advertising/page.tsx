		challenge:
			'Many businesses run paid advertising campaigns that produce clicks but not customers. Ad spend goes to broad audiences, landing pages are not matched to the ad message, and conversion tracking is not set up correctly so there is no reliable data on what is actually working. Budget is either wasted on traffic that does not convert or scaled up before the conversion funnel is validated.',
		challengePoints: [
			'High click volume with low conversion rates because landing pages are not matched to the ad',
			'Conversion tracking not properly configured, so reported ROAS figures are unreliable',
			'Campaigns targeting audiences that are too broad to convert at acceptable cost',
			'Budget scaled before the funnel is validated, amplifying a leaky system rather than a working one',

			'We build and manage paid campaigns structured around your conversion goals, with tracking configured correctly before launch, audiences built from your customer data, and landing pages aligned to each ad set. Budgets are scaled only after the funnel is validated with a smaller test spend.',

	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'What is a realistic cost per lead from Google or Meta ads?',
			a: 'This varies significantly by industry, competition, and conversion funnel quality. B2B professional services on LinkedIn might cost £80 to £200 per qualified lead. E-commerce acquisition on Meta might cost £10 to £40 per purchase. We give an estimated range during scoping based on benchmark data for your industry, then refine it based on actual campaign data from your first 30 days of spend.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How do you handle landing pages if we do not have one for each campaign?',
			a: 'We include a landing page assessment in every campaign setup. If your existing pages are not matched to the ad content or are not conversion-optimised, we either provide briefs for your development team to build from or implement dedicated pages as part of the engagement.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How much budget do you recommend starting with?',
			a: 'For Google Search campaigns, a minimum of £1,500 to £2,000 per month is needed to generate sufficient data to optimise. Meta Ads can start effectively from £1,000 per month on a focused objective. LinkedIn requires higher budgets due to higher cost-per-click — typically £3,000 per month minimum for B2B lead generation. These are starting points for testing, not recommended scale budgets.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Do you charge a percentage of ad spend or a fixed management fee?',
			a: 'We charge a fixed monthly management fee rather than a percentage of ad spend. This removes the incentive to increase your spend beyond what is justified by performance.',
		},
