	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'How long does SEO take to show results?',
			a: 'Technical fixes that remove indexation errors often show impact within four to eight weeks as search engines recrawl affected pages. Content changes to existing pages take two to four months to reflect in rankings. New content targeting competitive terms takes three to six months, depending on domain authority and the competitive landscape for the target queries. We set realistic timelines during scoping based on your specific situation.',
		},
		{
			q: 'What is GEO and how is it different from standard SEO?',
			a: "Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO) focuses on being cited and referenced by AI-powered answer surfaces like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google's AI Overviews. Standard SEO optimises for traditional blue-link rankings. The two overlap significantly — high-quality, authoritative content benefits both — but GEO additionally requires strong entity coverage, clear factual claims, and structured content that AI systems can extract and cite accurately.",
		},
		{
			q: 'Do you guarantee specific ranking positions?',
			a: 'No. No ethical SEO provider can guarantee specific positions because rankings are determined by search engine algorithms that factor in hundreds of variables, including competitor activity we cannot control. We commit to transparent reporting of what changed, what actions we took, and the measured impact on rankings and traffic.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Can you work with our existing website CMS?',
			a: 'Yes. Technical SEO work is largely independent of the CMS. We provide the fixes as specifications for your development team or implement them directly, depending on access. For structured data, meta tags, and content, we work within your CMS workflow.',
		},

	answerSummary:
		'UK and India businesses whose pages are not ranking despite being relevant to high-intent queries get technical SEO audits, commercial-intent keyword strategies, content briefs, local SEO, and generative engine optimisation for AI-powered search visibility.',
