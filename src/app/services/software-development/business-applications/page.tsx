	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'How do you scope a business application to avoid it becoming a large, complex project?',
			a: 'We start every business application engagement with a scoping workshop that maps the current manual process in detail, identifies the core problem that software needs to solve, and explicitly excludes the adjacent features that would be nice to have but are not needed for the core workflow. A focused application that does one thing well is more valuable to deliver quickly than a broad one that takes a year to launch.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Can you integrate the application with our existing systems?',
			a: 'Yes. Most business applications are useful specifically because they connect to existing systems and automate data flows between them. We assess the available integration methods for each system during scoping — most modern business software exposes a REST API, and older systems often have database access or file export options we can work with.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How long does a business application typically take to build?',
			a: 'A focused application covering a single operational workflow — a billing system, a returns processor, a commission calculator — typically takes six to twelve weeks. More complex applications with multiple modules and integrations take three to six months. The key determinant is how clearly defined the requirements are at the start and how quickly stakeholders can confirm decisions during development.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Do you build cloud based project management software?',
			a: 'Yes. Cloud based project management software is one of the most common business applications we develop. We build cloud project management software with task tracking, resource allocation, time logging, and reporting — designed around your team\'s actual workflow rather than adapted from an off-the-shelf product. The resulting system is hosted on your cloud account, owned outright, and free of per-seat licensing fees.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Do you build admin interfaces as part of the application?',
			a: 'Yes. Most business applications need an admin layer for configuration management, user administration, audit log review, and data correction. We build these as part of the application rather than requiring direct database access for administration tasks.',
		},
	],
	answerSummary:
		'UK and India businesses running manual processes around the edges of their software stack get focused workflow automation tools, billing engines, internal dashboards, and project tracking systems built exactly to the specific process that needs automating.',
