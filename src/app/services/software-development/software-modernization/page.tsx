			'Legacy systems accumulate technical debt until they become a significant operational constraint. They cannot be extended without risk. The developers who understand them have left. They run on unsupported infrastructure. Integration with modern tools is difficult or impossible. The business knows the system needs replacing but fears the disruption of migration — often because a previous attempt failed or because the system holds years of data the new system needs to accommodate.',

	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'How do you avoid a modernisation project becoming a multi-year failure?',
			a: 'Most legacy modernisation failures have a common cause: attempting to replace everything at once with a big-bang cut-over. We decompose modernisation into incremental phases — replacing or rebuilding one component at a time, validating it, and cutting over that component before touching the next. The legacy system continues operating throughout. Each phase has a clear scope, defined validation criteria, and a rollback path.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How do you handle data migration from a legacy system with poor data quality?',
			a: 'Data quality issues in legacy systems are very common — duplicate records, incomplete fields, inconsistent formats, and data that has never been validated. We conduct a data audit before migration design begins to understand the extent and nature of quality issues. We then build the migration pipeline with data cleansing rules, document the choices made in resolving quality issues, and validate the migrated data against the source before cut-over.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Can you modernise a system without documentation?',
			a: "Yes, and most legacy systems have little or no documentation. We start by running the legacy system and mapping what it actually does through code review, database schema analysis, and structured conversations with the people who use it. This produces a functional specification of the legacy system's behaviour that the new system is built to match. It takes longer than having documentation but is achievable.",
		},
		{
			q: 'How long does a typical software modernisation project take?',
			a: "A focused migration of a single application or module takes three to nine months. Comprehensive platform modernisation covering multiple interconnected systems takes one to three years when delivered incrementally. The timeline depends on the scope of the legacy system, the data volume being migrated, the complexity of dependencies between components, and how quickly the business can validate that the new system matches the old one's behaviour.",
		},
	],
	answerSummary:
		'UK and India organisations running legacy systems that cannot be extended, have no available expertise, or run on unsupported infrastructure get incremental migration, data validation, and parallel running that replaces ageing software without disrupting operations.',
