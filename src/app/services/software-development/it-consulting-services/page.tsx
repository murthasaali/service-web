    challenge:
      "Software development investments frequently underperform because the planning before build was insufficient. Requirements were unclear, the architecture was not designed before the first sprint, or the decision to build custom rather than buy an existing product was not properly evaluated. Organisations often reach us after an expensive failed project or partway through a build that has lost direction. Good consulting before development prevents most of these outcomes.",
    challengePoints: [
      "Development project started without clear requirements, producing rework when the scope is clarified mid-build",
      "Build versus buy decision made without analysis, committing to custom development where a product would have been faster and cheaper",
      "Architecture undocumented, so each developer makes local decisions that accumulate into structural problems",
      "Technology investment made without a strategic rationale, producing tools that do not connect to business outcomes"
    ],
    solution:
      "We provide the consulting layer before and during software development that most projects skip — requirements definition, build versus buy analysis, architecture design, and technology roadmapping. These are the decisions that determine whether a development investment succeeds or fails, and they are best made before the first line of code is written.",
    solutionPoints: [
      "Requirements definition producing a specification that development can build against without ambiguity",
      "Build versus buy analysis with vendor evaluation before committing to custom development",
      "Solution architecture design producing a documented architecture before build begins",
      "Technology roadmap connecting software investment to business objectives over a planning horizon"

  faqs: [
    { q: "Do you provide consulting separately from development, or only as part of a build project?", a: "Both. Many clients engage us for consulting independently — a technology roadmap, a requirements definition, a build versus buy analysis, or an architecture review — without a subsequent development engagement. We also provide consulting as the first phase of development projects. The two are separate service offerings that can be combined or used independently." },
    { q: "What does a build versus buy analysis involve?", a: "We document the requirements for the function in question, evaluate available products against those requirements using a structured scorecard, assess the integration effort for each option, and produce a recommendation with documented rationale. We include total cost of ownership analysis covering licence costs, implementation, integration, and maintenance over a three to five year period. The analysis typically takes two to three weeks." },
    { q: "How do you run requirements workshops for technical systems?", a: "We use structured facilitation to work through each user role, the tasks they need to perform, the data they work with, and the edge cases that are known to occur. We produce process maps and data flow diagrams during the workshops and circulate a written requirements document for review and sign-off. We distinguish between confirmed requirements, open questions, and explicitly out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep." },
    { q: "Can you review a project that is already in progress?", a: "Yes. We conduct in-flight project reviews when a development project has lost direction, exceeded its budget, or raised concerns about quality. The review covers requirements completeness, architecture quality, development progress against plan, and team capability. We produce findings and recommendations that the client can act on with their existing team or with our involvement." },
