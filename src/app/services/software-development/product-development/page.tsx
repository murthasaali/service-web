		challenge:
			'Product ideas fail in development for predictable reasons: building too much before getting user feedback, building for the ideal end-state rather than the minimum needed to validate the hypothesis, and underestimating the infrastructure work required to make a product production-ready rather than prototype-ready. Founders and product teams need a development partner who can set realistic scope, build quickly, and scale the product as it grows without requiring a full rebuild.',
		challengePoints: [
			'MVP scope defined too broadly, delaying launch until more can be built rather than validating the core value',
			'Prototype-quality code that works but cannot handle production traffic or scale',
			'No authentication, billing, or operational infrastructure because the prototype assumed those would be added later',
			'Development partner who builds to spec without product input, producing technically correct but commercially wrong solutions',
		],

			'We build MVPs and SaaS products that are genuinely production-ready at launch — with authentication, billing, monitoring, and the deployment infrastructure a live product needs.

	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'How do you define what should and should not be in an MVP?',
			a: 'We work through the core hypothesis — what user behaviour change does this product need to demonstrate to be considered successful? We then scope backward from that hypothesis to the minimum feature set needed to enable it. Features that are clearly needed for commercial success (authentication, billing) are included. Features that expand the use case or improve existing functionality go on the backlog for post-launch iteration.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How long does an MVP typically take to build?',
			a: 'A genuinely production-ready MVP covering a focused use case takes eight to sixteen weeks. Marketplaces, multi-tenant SaaS products, and products requiring regulatory compliance take longer — typically sixteen to twenty-four weeks. These timelines assume clear requirements and available stakeholders for decision-making; unclear requirements or slow feedback extend timelines significantly.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Can you take over development of a product that was started by another team?',
			a: 'Yes, though we start with a technical review of the existing codebase to understand its quality, architecture, and the extent of any technical debt. We share the findings with you before agreeing to take over development, so you understand what you are inheriting and what additional work may be needed before efficient iteration is possible.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Do you provide product management support alongside development?',
			a: 'We provide product input — challenge scope, suggest interaction patterns, flag technical implications of product decisions — but we do not operate as the product manager. The product decisions about what to build and in what priority order are yours. We work best when the client can give us a clear brief and fast feedback, and we contribute the technical perspective to product decisions rather than making them.',
