		challenge:
			'Most businesses have customer data spread across a CRM, a spreadsheet, an email inbox, and a helpdesk. Sales teams build personal contact lists outside the system. Marketing runs campaigns without knowing which contacts are already active customers. Support cannot see recent sales activity. The result is duplicate outreach, missed follow-ups, and deals lost because no one had the full picture.',

			'Customer records fragmented across multiple tools with no single source of truth',
			'Sales pipeline data out of date because reps find the CRM too slow to maintain',

	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'Which CRM platform do you recommend?',
			a: 'That depends on team size, budget, and complexity of your sales process. HubSpot is a strong fit for growing businesses that want a broad platform including marketing and support tools in one place. Salesforce suits larger organisations with complex sales processes or custom requirements. Pipedrive is a good choice for smaller sales teams that want a clean, fast pipeline tool without the overhead of a full platform. We assess your situation before recommending a specific platform.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How long does a CRM implementation take?',
			a: 'A standard HubSpot or Pipedrive implementation for a small to mid-size team typically takes two to four weeks. Salesforce implementations with significant customisation run four to eight weeks. The timeline depends mainly on data migration complexity, the number of integrations required, and how quickly stakeholders can confirm configuration decisions.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Can you migrate data from our existing spreadsheets or old CRM?',
			a: 'Yes. We handle data migration as part of most CRM implementations, including cleaning up duplicate records, mapping fields from the source to the target, and validating the import before going live. The more structured your existing data is, the faster this step goes.',
		},
		{
			q: 'What does the onboarding and training process look like?',
			a: 'We deliver a walkthrough session for each team using the CRM (typically sales, marketing, and support separately) covering the features relevant to their role. We also provide written documentation for common tasks and a recorded session your team can refer back to. Post-launch support is included for the first two weeks to handle questions as the team starts using the system.',
