			"When a support agent can't see a customer's order history, previous tickets, or billing status in one place, the conversation starts badly. Usually the data exists somewhere. It's just split across tools that don't talk to each other, or sitting in a CRM that hasn't been cleaned since it was set up. The work here is practical: deduplicating contact records, configuring ticket routing so queries reach the right team, connecting WhatsApp or email channels into a shared inbox, and making sure the information agents actually need shows up in the right place at the right time.",

		},
		{
			q: 'Why is CRM data cleanup a part of customer experience?',
			a: 'If your customer profiles are duplicate or disorganized, support agents cannot see accurate invoice histories, purchase dates, or previous logs. Cleaning the database ensures agents have the correct context immediately.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Do you write customer service response scripts?',
			a: 'No. We handle the technical setup—configuring ticket routing queues, API webhooks, databases, and survey triggers. We do not write customer service manuals or provide staffing.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How do automated surveys log customer scores?',
			a: 'We set up GTM triggers or helpdesk actions that send an email or chat link after a ticket closes. When the customer submits a score, the API writes the CSAT or NPS value directly to their CRM profile for reporting.',
