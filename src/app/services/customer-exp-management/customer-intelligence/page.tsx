    challenge:
      "Most businesses collect customer data but cannot easily analyse it. Transactional data is in one system, support data is in another, and behavioural data from the website or app is in a third. There is no combined view. Leadership makes decisions about customer strategy based on incomplete reports and intuition rather than a clear picture of what the data actually shows.",
    challengePoints: [
      "Customer data fragmented across CRM, support, billing, and analytics tools with no unified view",
      "No way to identify which customers are at risk of churning until they have already left",
      "Retention and loyalty decisions made without data on what is actually driving or reducing them",
      "Marketing and CX teams using different definitions of customer segments, leading to conflicting decisions"

      "We consolidate your customer data sources, build the segmentation models that matter for your business, and deliver the dashboards and alerts that make the insight actionable.

  faqs: [
    { q: "What data do you need to build a churn risk model?", a: "The most useful inputs are engagement signals specific to your product or service — login frequency for a SaaS product, purchase recency for a retailer, visit frequency for a hospitality business. You also need historical outcome data: which customers did and did not churn over a comparable past period. We assess what you have available during scoping and confirm whether a predictive model is feasible or whether a rules-based scoring approach is more appropriate given the data." },
    { q: "Do you build dashboards we can run ourselves, or does this require ongoing analyst involvement?", a: "We build dashboards in tools your team can maintain independently — Looker Studio, Tableau, or Power BI. After the build and a handover session, you own the dashboards and can update filters, date ranges, and views without needing us. Where the underlying data model needs structural changes, that requires developer involvement, but day-to-day use is self-service." },
    { q: "How do you consolidate data from multiple systems?", a: "We typically use a data warehouse like BigQuery or a customer data platform like Segment, with connectors to your CRM, support tool, e-commerce platform, and analytics tools. Records are joined on a common customer identifier — usually email address or an internal ID. We handle deduplication and data quality checks as part of the build." },
    { q: "Can you define segments based on our specific business logic?", a: "Yes. Standard frameworks like RFM are a useful starting point, but the most actionable segments are ones defined by your actual business model. For a subscription business that means different things than for a transactional retailer. We work with your team to define the segments that map to decisions you actually want to make, not generic categories." },
