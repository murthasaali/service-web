		challenge:
			'Customers interact with businesses across email, SMS, WhatsApp, social media, and in-app notifications. Most organisations handle each channel separately, with different tools, different teams, and no shared customer context.

Loyalty programmes are launched without the data infrastructure to make them work.',

	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'What makes a loyalty programme work beyond the launch phase?',
			a: 'Loyalty programmes that maintain engagement over time have earn mechanics that feel achievable, redemption options that are actually desirable, and regular communications that remind customers of their balance and status. Programmes that launch well but fade usually fail because the earn rate is too slow, the rewards feel out of reach, or the brand stops communicating about them after the initial campaign.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Is WhatsApp suitable for marketing messages or just transactional notifications?',
			a: "WhatsApp Business API supports both. Transactional messages like order confirmations and delivery updates are straightforward to send. Marketing messages require opt-in from the customer and must follow WhatsApp's message template guidelines. When set up correctly, WhatsApp typically achieves significantly higher open rates than email for the same message type.",
		},
		{
			q: 'How do you maintain a consistent experience across multiple channels?',
			a: 'We use a single customer data platform or CRM as the source of truth, with each channel pulling from the same customer record. Automation rules prevent the same customer from receiving the same message through multiple channels simultaneously, and contact preferences are honoured across all of them.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How do you measure customer engagement ROI?',
			a: 'We track the metrics that connect engagement activity to revenue outcomes — redemption rate for loyalty rewards, conversion rate on re-engagement campaigns, referral conversion rates, and change in purchase frequency for engaged versus non-engaged segments. These are reported in dashboards built as part of the engagement system setup.',
