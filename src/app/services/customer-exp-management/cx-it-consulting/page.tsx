    challenge: "Businesses building or overhauling their CX technology stack face a complex set of decisions. Dozens of platforms claim to solve the same problem. Integrations between tools require planning before purchase, not after. Legacy systems create constraints that narrow the options. Without independent technical guidance, organisations end up with over-engineered stacks, poorly integrated tools, and implementation projects that cost significantly more than anticipated.",
    challengePoints: [
      "Vendor selection driven by marketing claims rather than technical and operational fit",
      "Purchased platforms that cannot integrate with existing systems as promised",
      "CX technology projects that expand in scope and cost without clear governance",
      "No documented technology roadmap, so CX investments are reactive rather than planned",
    ],
    solution: "We provide independent advisory on CX platform selection, integration architecture, and implementation planning. We are not tied to any vendor, so recommendations are based on your actual requirements, existing systems, team capabilities, and budget — not on partnership incentives.",
    solutionPoints: [
      "Vendor-neutral platform assessment with scored evaluation against your specific requirements",
      "Integration architecture design before any platform purchase to identify compatibility issues",
      "Implementation roadmap with phased delivery, resource estimates, and dependency mapping",
      "Oversight during vendor implementation to protect against scope creep and missed requirements",
    ],

  benefits: [
    { title: "Independent Advice", description: "We are not tied to any platform vendor, so our recommendations reflect your needs rather than referral relationships. Vendor-neutral advice produces better procurement decisions." },
    { title: "Fewer Post-Purchase Surprises", description: "Integration architecture designed before platform purchase surfaces compatibility issues, licensing constraints, and missing connectors that would otherwise become expensive problems after contracts are signed." },
    { title: "Structured Investment Decisions", description: "A documented technology roadmap turns reactive CX technology spending into a planned programme with a clear rationale for sequencing and budget allocation." },
    { title: "Implementation Risk Reduced", description: "Independent oversight during implementation projects catches scope gaps, missed requirements, and vendor delivery issues before they reach go-live and become expensive to fix." },
    { title: "Alignment Between IT and CX Teams", description: "Technology decisions that affect both IT infrastructure and customer-facing operations require both perspectives. Our advisory bridges that gap, producing plans both teams can support." },
    { title: "Faster Platform Selection", description: "A structured evaluation with a clear scorecard and requirement set compresses platform selection from months of internal debate into a focused assessment process." },

  faqs: [
    { q: "How is your advisory different from using the platform vendor's own consultants?", a: "Vendor consultants are expert in their platform and genuinely useful for configuration and implementation. They are not the right resource for platform selection because they are not independent — they will recommend their own product. We assess multiple options against your requirements and are only invested in the outcome being right for you." },
    { q: "What does an integration architecture assessment involve?", a: "We map your planned technology stack and document the data flows between systems — what customer data needs to move where, how often, and triggered by what events. We identify integration patterns (native connector, iPaaS middleware, or custom API), flag where connectors do not exist or are limited in scope, and produce a diagram and written specification the implementation team can work from." },
    { q: "Do you also handle the implementation, or just the advisory?", a: "We can do both. Advisory engagements focus on platform selection, architecture design, and roadmapping. Implementation engagements involve hands-on configuration, integration build, and delivery. Many clients use us for advisory first to make the right decisions, then for implementation. We can also provide independent oversight of an implementation being run by another party." },
    { q: "How long does a CX technology roadmap take to produce?", a: "A roadmap covering a mid-size business's CX technology stack typically takes three to four weeks. This includes stakeholder interviews with CX, IT, and operations leads, an audit of the current technology landscape, requirements gathering, and the written roadmap document with sequenced phases and rationale." },
