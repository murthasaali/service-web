	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'Which helpdesk platform do you recommend for a small support team?',
			a: "For teams under 10 agents, Freshdesk's free tier or HubSpot Service Hub's Starter plan offer solid foundations without cost overhead. Zendesk is a strong choice if you anticipate growth and need more sophisticated automation and reporting. Intercom is the right fit if you are primarily running chat-based support on a web app or SaaS product. We recommend based on your channel mix and expected volume.",
		},
		{
			q: 'How do you handle migration from a shared email inbox to a helpdesk?',
			a: 'We configure the helpdesk to pull in emails from your existing support address so there is no disruption during the transition. Existing open queries can be imported as tickets. The changeover is transparent to customers — they continue emailing the same address.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Can the helpdesk integrate with our existing CRM?',
			a: 'Yes. Most major helpdesk platforms have native integrations with Salesforce, HubSpot, and Zoho, so ticket data and customer history are shared between systems. Where native integration is limited, we use Zapier or direct API connections.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How long does it take to build and populate a knowledge base?',
			a: 'A foundational knowledge base covering the top 20 to 30 customer queries typically takes one to two weeks to structure and write. We work with your support team to identify the most common queries and draft the articles, then hand over for review and approval. Ongoing content is managed by your team after handover.',
