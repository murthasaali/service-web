    challenge:
      "Platform-based stores are fast to launch but hit their limits quickly. Custom pricing rules that don't fit the standard discount system, fulfilment workflows that require integration with an internal warehouse tool, or a checkout experience that needs to match the brand — all of these become workarounds that accumulate technical debt over time.",
    challengePoints: [
      "Pricing and discount logic that doesn't fit the platform's built-in options",
      "Checkout flow that doesn't match the brand or user journey",

      "Platform fees and transaction costs that grow with revenue"

      "We build the store against your actual requirements: the product structure, the pricing logic, the fulfilment process, and the customer journey. Payment processing goes through Stripe so you own the relationship, and the order data connects directly to whatever system manages fulfilment.",

  faqs: [
    { q: "Should we use Shopify or build a custom store?", a: "Shopify is the right choice if your product catalogue and pricing are straightforward and you want a fast launch with minimal custom development. Custom makes sense when your pricing rules, product configuration, or fulfilment integration can't be handled cleanly within Shopify's model, or when platform transaction fees become a meaningful cost at your revenue level." },
    { q: "How do you handle subscription billing?", a: "We use Stripe Billing for subscriptions. It handles recurring charges, dunning for failed payments, prorated upgrades, and invoice generation. Your application logic manages what the customer gets access to based on their subscription state." },
    { q: "Can the store connect to our existing inventory system?", a: "Yes. If your inventory system has an API, we build a sync layer that keeps stock levels consistent between the store and the inventory system. If it doesn't have an API, we discuss what integration is feasible based on what data it can export." },
    { q: "What happens to orders after checkout?", a: "That depends on your fulfilment process. We build whatever happens next: an email to the warehouse, a record created in an ERP, a webhook to a logistics API, or a status visible in an internal dashboard. The order event from Stripe triggers whatever the business needs." },
