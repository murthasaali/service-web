	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'Should we use a separate frontend and backend or a full-stack framework?',
			a: 'It depends on the project. For most web applications Next.js handles both well and keeps things simple. For products that need a separate mobile app consuming the same API, or where the backend is significantly more complex than the frontend, a separate API server makes more sense. We discuss this during scoping.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How do you handle database changes after the application is live?',
			a: 'We set up database migration tooling from the start so schema changes are applied in a controlled, reversible way. Migrations are versioned in the repository alongside the application code.',
		},
		{
			q: 'What does the handover package include?',
			a: 'The repository, a README covering the architecture and development setup, documented environment variables, the deployment configuration, and a walkthrough of how the main application flows work. We run through this together rather than just sending a zip file.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Do you offer ongoing support after the project is delivered?',
			a: 'Yes. We offer a support period after launch to handle any issues that appear in production, and ongoing retainer arrangements for teams that want regular development support beyond the initial build.',
		},

	answerSummary:
		'UK and India teams whose web applications suffer from coordination overhead between separate frontend and backend teams with mismatched contracts get full-stack builds from a single team covering React frontend, Node backend, database, and deployment with consistent patterns across every layer.',
