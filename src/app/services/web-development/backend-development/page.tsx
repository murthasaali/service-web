    challenge: "Frontend work gets the attention, but backend problems are what actually break products. An API that doesn't handle errors gracefully, a database schema designed around one use case that can't accommodate the next one, authentication that wasn't built with roles in mind from the start — these are the issues that cause rewrites six months after launch.",
    challengePoints: [
      "API endpoints with no error handling or inconsistent response formats",
      "Database schema that doesn't scale as the product grows",
      "Authentication that doesn't support multiple roles or organisations",
      "No documentation for how the backend works or how to extend it",
    ],
    solution: "We design the database schema and API structure before writing a line of code, discuss trade-offs upfront, and build with extension in mind. Every endpoint is documented, every integration is tested with real credentials, and the codebase is handed over with enough context for any developer to pick it up.",
    solutionPoints: [
      "Database design reviewed before implementation begins",
      "REST or GraphQL APIs with consistent error handling and versioning",
      "Role-based authentication with JWT or session management",
      "Full API documentation in Postman or OpenAPI format",

  faqs: [
    { q: "What database should we use for our project?", a: "For most web applications PostgreSQL is a solid default. It handles relational data, JSON fields, and scales well. If your data is genuinely document-oriented or you need flexible schemas, MongoDB is worth considering. We discuss the trade-offs during scoping so the choice is based on your actual data structure and query patterns." },
    { q: "Do you build both the frontend and backend, or just one?", a: "We can do either. Many projects start with just the backend API and connect it to an existing or separately built frontend. Others are full-stack builds. We scope each project based on what you actually need." },
    { q: "How do you handle environment secrets and credentials?", a: "We use environment variables managed through your deployment platform and never commit secrets to the repository. We provide a documented list of required environment variables for each deployment environment." },
    { q: "What happens if we need to change the database schema after launch?", a: "We set up database migration tooling as part of every backend project so schema changes can be applied and rolled back in a controlled way without manual SQL on the production server." },
