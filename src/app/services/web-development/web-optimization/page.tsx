    challenge: "A slow website loses visitors before they convert. Pages that fail Core Web Vitals assessments are penalised in Google search rankings. Security gaps leave the site exposed to compromise. Accessibility failures exclude users and create legal exposure. These are all measurable, fixable problems — but they tend to accumulate quietly until they start affecting revenue or search visibility.",
    challengePoints: [
      "Page load times above three seconds driving measurable bounce rate increases",

      "Outdated dependencies and missing security headers leaving the site vulnerable",
      "Accessibility failures that exclude users and risk compliance issues under WCAG guidelines",
    ],
    solution: "We run a systematic audit of your site's performance, security posture, and accessibility compliance, produce a prioritised list of issues, and fix them. Every change is benchmarked before and after so you can see exactly what improved. Work is done in your development environment and released through your existing deployment process, not around it.",

  faqs: [
    { q: "How do you prioritise what to fix first?", a: "We start with the items that have the biggest measurable impact on load time, Core Web Vitals scores, or security risk. For most sites, image optimisation and removing render-blocking scripts deliver the largest performance gains with the least risk. Security fixes like missing headers are quick to apply and high priority regardless of impact on speed. We share the full prioritised list before starting so you can adjust the scope." },
    { q: "Can you optimise a site you did not build?", a: "Yes. We work with existing sites built on any stack — WordPress, Webflow, Next.js, custom builds. We start with a read-only audit before touching any code, so you understand what we are proposing before we make changes." },
    { q: "Will the optimisations break our existing design or functionality?", a: "Optimisations are applied incrementally and tested against the existing design before being released. We do not make structural changes to layouts or remove functionality. Accessibility fixes modify markup to meet standards but do not change visual appearance." },
    { q: "How long does an optimisation project typically take?", a: "A performance audit and the top-priority fixes typically take one to two weeks for a standard marketing site. A full WCAG audit with remediation can take two to four weeks depending on the number of pages and the severity of issues found. We give a time estimate after the initial audit, not before, so it is based on actual findings." },
