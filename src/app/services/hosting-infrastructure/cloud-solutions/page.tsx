    challenge: "On-premise infrastructure or legacy hosting arrangements create fixed costs regardless of actual usage, require specialist maintenance, and cannot scale quickly when demand changes. Businesses running critical workloads on ageing infrastructure face increasing reliability risk and are locked out of the services that modern cloud platforms provide — managed databases, serverless functions, container orchestration, and global content delivery.",
    challengePoints: [
      "Fixed infrastructure costs with no ability to scale capacity up or down with demand",
      "On-premise hardware approaching end of life with increasing maintenance burden",
      "Manual deployment and configuration processes that slow down development cycles",
      "Disaster recovery plans that exist on paper but are not regularly tested or automated",
    ],
    solution: "We design and implement cloud architectures on AWS, Azure, or GCP that match your workload requirements, migrate existing applications without disruption, and configure the infrastructure-as-code and monitoring that makes ongoing management efficient rather than manual.",

A cloud architecture with auto-scaling groups and a CDN resolved both problems." },

  benefits: [
    { title: "Capacity That Scales With Demand", description: "Cloud resources scale up during peak load and down during quiet periods, removing the choice between over-provisioning for peaks or under-provisioning for normal load." },
    { title: "Reduced Infrastructure Management Overhead", description: "Managed cloud services — databases, queues, container orchestration — shift maintenance responsibility to the provider, freeing your team from patching, backups, and hardware management." },
    { title: "Reproducible Environments", description: "Infrastructure-as-code means development, staging, and production environments can be created consistently and reverted to a known state, removing environment drift as a source of bugs." },
    { title: "Built-in Redundancy", description: "Multi-availability zone deployments provide redundancy that is prohibitively expensive to replicate with on-premise hardware, at a fraction of the cost of equivalent physical infrastructure." },
    { title: "Controlled Costs", description: "Cloud environments sized correctly for actual usage and monitored for waste produce predictable costs. Regular optimisation reviews prevent the gradual cost creep that affects unmanaged cloud accounts." },

  faqs: [
    { q: "How do you decide between AWS, Azure, and GCP?", a: "The choice depends on your existing technology stack, team familiarity, and workload characteristics. AWS has the broadest service catalogue and is generally the strongest choice for new projects. Azure is the natural fit if you have existing Microsoft infrastructure — Active Directory, SQL Server, Office 365. GCP is worth considering for data-intensive workloads and machine learning use cases. Most businesses do not need to evaluate all three — one is usually a clear fit given their context." },
    { q: "How much disruption does a cloud migration typically cause?", a: "A well-planned migration should cause minimal disruption. We use a lift-and-shift approach for the initial migration, running the cloud environment in parallel with the existing one and switching over during a low-traffic window. Applications that require architectural changes for cloud are refactored as a separate phase after the initial migration is stable." },
    { q: "How do you manage cloud costs after migration?", a: "We configure billing alerts, implement tagging policies for cost attribution, and schedule a cost review at 30 and 90 days post-migration. We also review reserved instance purchasing once the usage pattern is stable, which typically reduces compute costs by 30 to 40 percent compared to on-demand pricing." },
    { q: "What security standards do you configure by default?", a: "By default we configure IAM with least-privilege policies, multi-factor authentication for console access, encryption at rest and in transit for all storage and database services, VPC with private subnets for application workloads, CloudTrail or equivalent audit logging, and automated security scanning for common misconfigurations. Additional controls are added based on compliance requirements." },
