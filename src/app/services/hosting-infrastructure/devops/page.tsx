		challenge:
			'Development teams without a proper CI/CD pipeline deploy manually, infrequently, and with high anxiety. Releases are risky, rollbacks are painful, and the time between a feature being ready and it being live is measured in weeks rather than hours. Infrastructure is configured manually on individual servers, creating snowflake environments that cannot be reproduced and are difficult to debug when something goes wrong in production.',
		challengePoints: [
			'Manual deployments that are error-prone and require developer availability for every release',
			'No automated testing in the deployment pipeline, so bugs reach production that could have been caught',
			'Infrastructure configured manually with no version control or reproducibility',
			'Long release cycles because deployment risk discourages frequent shipping',
		],
		solution:
			'We implement CI/CD pipelines that automate build, test, and deployment stages, configure infrastructure-as-code so environments are reproducible, and containerise applications to eliminate environment-specific inconsistencies. The result is a deployment process that is faster, safer, and requires less manual coordination.',

	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'Which CI/CD platform do you recommend?',
			a: 'GitHub Actions is the most common choice for teams already using GitHub, and the free tier covers most small to mid-size team needs. GitLab CI is the natural choice for GitLab users and offers a comprehensive feature set. CircleCI offers more fine-grained control over pipeline resources. The choice is usually determined by your existing version control platform rather than being a standalone decision.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Do we need Kubernetes or is Docker Compose sufficient?',
			a: 'For most applications with fewer than a handful of services, Docker Compose on a managed hosting platform or a single server is sufficient and significantly simpler to operate. Kubernetes is justified when you need horizontal autoscaling, multi-service orchestration, rolling deployments, or are running at a scale where the operational benefits outweigh the complexity. We recommend the simplest approach that meets your actual requirements.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How disruptive is it to introduce CI/CD to an existing project?',
			a: 'Less disruptive than most teams expect. We introduce CI/CD incrementally, starting with the build and basic test steps before adding deployment stages. The pipeline can run alongside existing deployment processes until the team is confident in it. The main dependency is having a reasonable test suite — we often recommend adding basic automated tests as part of the same engagement.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Can you set up DevOps for a team that has no existing infrastructure-as-code?',
			a: 'Yes. Many of our DevOps engagements start from scratch with teams running on manually provisioned servers. We document the existing infrastructure, implement infrastructure-as-code for all components, and migrate environments into the new setup incrementally to avoid disruption.',
