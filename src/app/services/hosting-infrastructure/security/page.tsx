    challenge: "Infrastructure security is typically treated as a setup-once concern rather than an ongoing discipline. Default configurations are left in place, security headers are missing, backups exist but have never been tested, and disaster recovery plans are theoretical documents that have never been exercised. Businesses often discover these gaps only when a breach, ransomware incident, or catastrophic data loss event forces them into a recovery scenario they were not prepared for.",
    challengePoints: [
      "Default server configurations with open ports, default credentials, and unnecessary services running",
      "Backup systems that run automatically but whose restores have never been tested",
      "No documented disaster recovery plan, so a recovery scenario would be improvised under pressure",
      "Missing security headers and outdated dependencies creating known vulnerability exposure",

We applied a hardening baseline, installed fail2ban, and configured the firewall to restrict unnecessary exposure." },

  faqs: [
    { q: "What does a security audit cover and how long does it take?", a: "A standard infrastructure security audit covers server configuration hardening status, open port and service exposure, SSL and TLS configuration, security header implementation, software dependency versions and known CVEs, access control review, and backup configuration. It typically takes three to five days to complete and produces a prioritised findings report. We triage findings by severity so you know which to address first." },
    { q: "What is the difference between a backup and a disaster recovery plan?", a: "A backup is a copy of your data stored somewhere separate from your production system. Disaster recovery planning covers the full set of procedures needed to restore operations after a serious incident — it uses backups as one input but also covers which systems need to be restored in what order, what the acceptable recovery time is, and who does what in a recovery scenario. A DR plan without tested backups is not meaningful, and tested backups without a DR plan leave your recovery process undefined." },
    { q: "How often should security audits be repeated?", a: "For most businesses, an annual security audit is a minimum. Audits should also be triggered by significant infrastructure changes — migrating to new hosting, deploying new applications, or adding new team members with system access. Continuous vulnerability scanning is a complement to periodic audits, not a replacement." },
    { q: "Do you provide penetration testing as part of security services?", a: "Our security audit service covers infrastructure configuration review and vulnerability scanning, which addresses the most common gaps. Full penetration testing requires a different engagement with a specialist pen testing team and explicit written authorisation. We can recommend suitable providers for this if it is required for compliance purposes." },
