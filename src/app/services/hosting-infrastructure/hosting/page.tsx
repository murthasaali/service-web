    challenge:
      "Hosting decisions are often made based on cost alone, without considering the reliability, performance, or support requirements of the applications being hosted. Cheap shared hosting creates performance and security problems as traffic grows. Unmanaged VPS or dedicated servers are provisioned but never properly configured, secured, or monitored. Businesses end up with hosting that technically works until it fails, at which point there is no clear owner of the problem.",
    challengePoints: [
      "Shared hosting causing slow page loads and unpredictable availability as the site grows",

  faqs: [
    { q: "What is the difference between shared hosting, VPS, and dedicated hosting?", a: "Shared hosting puts multiple sites on the same server sharing all resources, making it unpredictable under load and inappropriate for anything beyond simple low-traffic sites. VPS gives you a virtualised portion of a physical server with guaranteed resources, suitable for most business applications. Dedicated hosting gives you an entire physical server, appropriate for high-traffic applications or those with strict security requirements. Managed hosting platforms like Vercel or Render abstract all of this away at the cost of flexibility and, sometimes, higher pricing at scale." },
    { q: "Should we use a managed platform like Vercel or run our own server?", a: "Managed platforms are generally the right choice for web applications and sites built on modern frameworks, because they handle SSL, CDN, scaling, and deployment infrastructure. A VPS or dedicated server is more appropriate when you need custom server configuration, are running non-web workloads, or have workloads where managed platform pricing becomes expensive at scale." },
    { q: "How do you handle SSL certificate management?", a: "For server-based hosting we use Let's Encrypt certificates with automated renewal via Certbot, monitored to alert before expiry. For managed platforms, SSL is handled by the platform. For custom certificate requirements such as extended validation or wildcard certificates across many subdomains, we assess the best approach based on your specific needs." },
    { q: "What backup frequency do you recommend?", a: "For databases containing active business data, daily automated backups with 30-day retention are a standard starting point. For file storage, daily or weekly depending on how frequently content changes. The most important thing is that backups are regularly tested — a backup that has never been successfully restored is not a meaningful safeguard." },
