		paragraphs: [
			"Bad deployments are almost always a process problem, not a code problem. Someone pushed directly to production, there was no staging environment to catch the issue first, and now the rollback is manual and stressful. Getting the infrastructure right means putting those safeguards in before they're needed: separate environments for testing and live, automated backups that actually get tested, deployment pipelines that can roll back in under a minute, and monitoring that alerts the right people before users notice something is wrong. The setup is documented in plain language so your team understands what's running and what it costs.",

	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'How do you explain the difference between AWS, Google Cloud, and basic hosting?',
			a: 'Basic hosting shares server hardware with other websites, which can cause slowdowns. Cloud providers like AWS and Google Cloud isolate your resources on virtual servers, allowing us to configure isolated environments, set up dedicated database backups, and expand CPU capacity during peak loads.',
		},
		{
			q: 'What happens if a new code deployment crashes our live application?',
			a: 'We build deployment pipelines with a rollback strategy. If the live app encounters errors after a release, our script immediately redirects traffic back to the previously built version. This recovery process takes less than 30 seconds.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How do we verify that our database backups actually work?',
			a: 'We establish a restore drill as part of our backup policy. Every month, our scripts restore a recent database snapshot to an isolated staging database and verify that schemas and record counts match the live production state.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Do you retain control over our cloud hosting credentials?',
			a: 'No. We configure all servers and databases directly within your own billing accounts on AWS, Vercel, or Google Cloud. You retain administrative master credentials, and we access the resources through restricted IAM team permissions that you can revoke at any time.',
