    challenge:
      "Many businesses know they need to modernise their technology but cannot get past the question of where to start. Technology decisions are made reactively in response to immediate problems rather than as part of a coordinated plan. Different departments pursue their own systems without considering how they connect. Investment is approved without clear success criteria, and two years later the business is not materially different despite significant spend.",
    challengePoints: [
      "Technology investments approved without a unifying strategy or prioritisation framework",
      "Department-level decisions creating a fragmented stack with no integration plan",
      "Digital transformation programmes that start with energy but lose direction and momentum",
      "No mechanism to evaluate whether previous technology investments have delivered their intended outcomes"
    ],
    solution:
      "We work with leadership teams to define the technology strategy that serves their business objectives, produce a sequenced roadmap of investments, and create the governance structures that keep transformation on track. Recommendations are grounded in what is achievable given your budget, team, and existing systems — not what would be ideal in an unconstrained scenario.",
    solutionPoints: [

    { title: "Independent Perspective", description: "An independent assessment is not influenced by vendor relationships, internal politics, or sunk cost in previous decisions, producing recommendations based on what is right rather than what is comfortable." },

  faqs: [
    { q: "What is the difference between a technology strategy and a technology roadmap?", a: "A technology strategy defines the principles, objectives, and investment priorities that guide technology decisions over the planning horizon — the why and what. A technology roadmap translates that strategy into a sequenced plan of specific initiatives, timelines, and dependencies — the when and how. Both are needed. A strategy without a roadmap produces good intentions with no delivery path. A roadmap without a strategy produces a to-do list with no coherent direction." },
    { q: "How do you approach a digital transformation engagement?", a: "We start with a current state assessment covering your existing technology, processes, and organisational capability. We then work with stakeholders to define the desired future state and the objectives it needs to achieve. From that gap, we produce a prioritised roadmap. Throughout, we test recommendations against the practical constraints of your budget, team, and existing systems rather than designing for an unconstrained scenario." },
    { q: "How long does a technology roadmap take to produce?", a: "A roadmap for a mid-size organisation typically takes four to six weeks. This includes stakeholder interviews across IT, operations, and leadership, a technology audit, prioritisation workshops, and the written roadmap document with rationale. Simpler scopes can be done in two to three weeks. More complex multi-entity or regulatory environments take longer." },
    { q: "Do you help with implementation, or just advisory?", a: "We provide both. Many clients use us first for strategy and roadmap development, then for implementation of specific initiatives on the roadmap. Delivering both allows us to hold the strategic intent through implementation rather than handing over a document and leaving. Clients also sometimes engage us for implementation oversight when they are using other implementation partners." },
