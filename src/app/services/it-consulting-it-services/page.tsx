      "Most technology decisions get made without a clear picture of what's already there. A company pays for three tools that overlap, runs servers twice the size they need, and has no documented process for what happens if a key system goes down. An IT audit starts by mapping what exists: the architecture, the access controls, the billing, and the vendor contracts. From there it identifies where the real risks and inefficiencies are. The output is a set of specific, prioritised recommendations. Not a deck full of frameworks, but a document your technical team can act on.",
