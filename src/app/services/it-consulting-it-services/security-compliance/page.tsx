	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'What is the difference between a security assessment and a penetration test?',
			a: 'A security assessment reviews policies, configurations, processes, and controls against a framework — it identifies gaps in how you are set up. A penetration test actively attempts to exploit vulnerabilities to determine whether they are actually exploitable — it tests what an attacker could achieve. Both are valuable but serve different purposes. Most organisations need a security assessment first to identify and close obvious gaps, then a penetration test to validate that the remaining controls hold against active exploitation.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Which compliance framework is most relevant for us?',
			a: 'That depends on your industry, the type of data you process, and your customer requirements. GDPR applies to any organisation processing personal data of EU or UK residents. Cyber Essentials is required for UK government contracts and is a useful baseline for any business. ISO 27001 is the most internationally recognised standard and is often required by enterprise customers. PCI DSS applies if you store, process, or transmit payment card data. We assess which frameworks are relevant during the initial scoping conversation.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How long does a compliance gap analysis take?',
			a: 'A gap analysis against a single framework like Cyber Essentials typically takes one to two weeks for a small to mid-size organisation. ISO 27001 gap analysis takes three to four weeks because the scope is broader. The time depends on how much documentation already exists and how accessible your technical team is for interviews.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Do you help with implementation after identifying gaps?',
			a: 'Yes. Identifying gaps without supporting their remediation produces a report that sits on a shelf. We provide implementation support — configuring technical controls, drafting or updating policies, and working with your team to close the identified gaps within the agreed timeframe.',
