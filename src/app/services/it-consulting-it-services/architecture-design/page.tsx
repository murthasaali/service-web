  solves: {
    challenge:
      "Build decisions made without proper architecture produce systems that work in the short term but become progressively harder to maintain, extend, and integrate. APIs built without a contract, databases designed without a schema review, microservices introduced before the team is ready to operate them. The debt from these decisions accumulates silently until it stops a future initiative in its tracks or requires expensive rearchitecture.",
    challengePoints: [
      "Systems built without upfront architecture that become increasingly expensive to extend",
      "Integration problems discovered after both systems were built rather than designed for from the start",
      "Technology choices made without evaluation criteria, leading to regret when the limitations emerge",
      "No architecture documentation, so knowledge of why decisions were made lives only with the person who made them"
    ],
    solution:
      "We provide architecture review and design services at the point in a project where decisions can still be made at low cost — before build begins or at the start of a significant new capability. We produce architecture designs and decision records that development teams can implement against and future architects can understand.",

  faqs: [
    { q: "When in a project should architecture work happen?", a: "The ideal point is before significant build work begins — at the point where you have defined requirements but have not yet started implementation. For significant new capabilities being added to existing systems, architecture review should happen at the start of the feature design phase. The further into development an architecture issue is discovered, the more expensive it is to address." },
    { q: "What is an architecture decision record (ADR)?", a: "An architecture decision record is a short document that captures a significant architectural decision — what was decided, why it was chosen over the alternatives, and what the trade-offs accepted were. ADRs are stored with the codebase and give future developers the context to understand why things are the way they are, rather than having to guess from the implementation alone." },
    { q: "Do you review architecture for existing systems as well as new ones?", a: "Yes. Architecture reviews of existing systems — also called technical reviews or architecture assessments — are valuable when you are planning significant extensions, experiencing performance or reliability problems, or preparing for a due diligence process. They produce a current-state assessment with identified risks and a target architecture recommendation." },
    { q: "How detailed does solution architecture documentation need to be?", a: "It needs to be detailed enough that a development team can implement to it without making significant undocumented decisions themselves, but not so detailed that it becomes a maintenance burden as the implementation evolves. We aim for component-level diagrams, data model definitions, API contract specifications, and narrative descriptions of key design decisions — typically a 15 to 30 page document depending on system complexity." },
