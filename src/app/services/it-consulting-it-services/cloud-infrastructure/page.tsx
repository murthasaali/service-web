    challenge:
      "Cloud adoption without a coherent strategy produces fragmented environments, uncontrolled costs, and a security posture that is harder to manage than the on-premise infrastructure it replaced. Organisations migrate to cloud reactively — moving workloads without redesigning them — or adopt cloud services inconsistently across teams, creating a multi-account sprawl that no one can audit or govern effectively.",
    challengePoints: [
      "Cloud costs growing without a corresponding understanding of what is driving them",
      "Multiple cloud accounts or providers adopted by different teams with no central governance",
      "Applications migrated to cloud without redesign, carrying the same performance and reliability limitations",
      "Security configuration inconsistent across cloud environments with no unified policy"

  faqs: [
    { q: "What is a cloud migration strategy and why do we need one before migrating?", a: "A cloud migration strategy defines which workloads to migrate, in what order, using what approach, and to what target architecture. Without it, workloads get migrated reactively — typically by lifting applications to cloud VMs without redesign — producing a cloud environment that has higher costs, lower reliability, and harder security management than an environment designed for cloud from the start. A strategy also identifies workloads that are better left on-premise or replaced rather than migrated." },
    { q: "How do you approach cloud cost optimisation without affecting performance or reliability?", a: "We start with a cost analysis that separates waste (idle resources, unused services, unattached storage) from over-provisioning (resources provisioned larger than actual usage requires). Waste can typically be eliminated without any performance impact. Over-provisioning requires testing to confirm the reduced size handles actual load. We recommend changes in order of cost impact and implementation risk, so the easiest wins come first." },
    { q: "What is a Well-Architected review?", a: "AWS, Azure, and GCP each publish architectural best practices frameworks. A Well-Architected review assesses your cloud environment against these frameworks across pillars including security, reliability, performance, cost optimisation, and operational excellence. It produces a prioritised findings report. It is a structured way to identify gaps in cloud environments that were built incrementally rather than to a designed architecture." },
    { q: "Do you provide implementation services or just advisory?", a: "Both. Cloud architecture consulting typically starts with an advisory phase to design the right architecture before implementation begins. We also handle implementation — building infrastructure-as-code, configuring security controls, executing migrations, and setting up governance tooling. Many clients engage us for both so the architecture intent is carried through to the implemented reality." },
