		challenge:
			'Development and operations teams working without common processes spend more time coordinating deployments than building features. Developers wait for operations to provision environments.

	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'How is DevOps & Automation different from the DevOps service under Hosting & Infrastructure?',
			a: "The Hosting & Infrastructure DevOps service focuses primarily on the implementation of specific infrastructure tools — CI/CD pipelines, containers, Kubernetes. The IT Consulting DevOps & Automation service covers the consulting layer alongside implementation — advising on which tools to adopt, how to structure the team's processes, how to define SLOs, and how to build the on-call and incident response culture that makes DevOps practices sustainable.",
		},
		{
			q: 'How long does it take to implement a CI/CD pipeline from scratch?',
			a: 'A basic CI/CD pipeline with build, test, and deployment stages for a single service typically takes one to two weeks to implement. Adding multiple deployment environments, approval gates, and additional services takes longer. The most common delay is the automated test suite — if you have minimal test coverage, we often recommend building foundational tests as part of the same engagement.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Do we need Kubernetes?',
			a: 'Most teams do not need Kubernetes, especially in early stages. The operational complexity of running Kubernetes is significant — it requires expertise to configure and maintain, and the benefits are most relevant when you are managing multiple services that need independent scaling and deployment. We help teams make this assessment honestly, often recommending simpler container deployment options like ECS, Render, or Docker Compose on a managed host.',
		},
		{
			q: 'What does a DevOps practice assessment involve?',
			a: 'We assess your current deployment process, on-call setup, incident response procedures, and observability against a DevOps maturity framework. We produce a findings report identifying the highest-impact improvements and a recommended implementation sequence, prioritised by the problems causing the most friction for your team today.',
