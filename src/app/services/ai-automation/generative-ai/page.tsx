	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'What is the difference between a fine-tuned model and a RAG system?',
			a: "Fine-tuning adjusts the model's weights using your data, changing how it responds at a foundational level. This is expensive and mostly useful for style adaptation or specialised domain language. RAG retrieves relevant documents from an index at query time and provides them as context, without changing the base model. RAG is better for most business use cases where the data changes frequently or needs to stay up to date.",
		},
		{
			q: 'How do you prevent the AI from giving wrong or fabricated answers?',
			a: 'For RAG systems, we use strict source-grounding: the model only answers based on retrieved documents and indicates when no relevant content was found. We configure appropriate confidence thresholds, add human review checkpoints for high-stakes outputs, and test systematically with adversarial inputs to identify failure modes before deployment.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Is our company data kept private when we use these models?',
			a: 'This depends on the deployment model we use. API calls to OpenAI or Anthropic do not use your data to train future models under their business agreements. For highest sensitivity requirements, we can deploy open-source models like Llama within your own cloud infrastructure, ensuring your data never leaves your environment.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Can the AI output feed directly into our existing software?',
			a: 'Yes. We build structured output pipelines where the LLM produces JSON or formatted data rather than free text, which then feeds directly into your application logic, CRM, document management system, or workflow automation.',
		},
