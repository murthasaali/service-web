			'Operations teams often waste hours each week on tasks a computer could handle.

	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'How long does it take to automate a typical business workflow?',
			a: 'Simple automations connecting two or three tools typically take one to two weeks from scoping to handover. Multi-step workflows involving data transformation, conditional routing, and error handling usually take three to five weeks depending on the number of integration points and API complexity.',
		},
		{
			q: 'What happens when one of our connected tools updates their API?',
			a: 'We build automations with version-pinned API connections where possible and document all integration dependencies. If a connected tool changes and breaks the automation, your runbook will include the steps to identify and update the affected connector. We also offer a support retainer to handle breaking changes on your behalf.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Do we need technical staff to maintain the automations after handover?',
			a: 'No. We deliver documented runbooks written for non-technical staff that explain what each automation does, what triggers it, and how to restart it if it stops. Platforms like n8n have visual interfaces your operations team can navigate without writing code.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Can you automate processes that involve legacy software without an API?',
			a: 'Yes. For legacy software that has no API, we build browser automation scripts using tools like Playwright or Puppeteer that navigate the UI, fill in fields, and submit forms exactly as a human operator would.',
