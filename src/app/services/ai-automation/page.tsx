			'Most businesses reach a point where someone is downloading a spreadsheet, copying it into another tool, and sending it somewhere else. Every day. That kind of manual work is slow, error-prone, and quietly expensive. The work here is figuring out exactly where those friction points are, then connecting your existing tools so the data moves on its own. That might mean routing invoice emails directly into your accounting system, syncing form submissions into your CRM, or generating a management report without anyone touching a keyboard. You get the logic documented, the error handling built in, and the whole thing handed over so your team can understand and maintain it.',

	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'What happens if an automated workflow fails or an API goes down?',
			a: 'We build workflows with error handling. If a third-party API returns an error, the system records the log, triggers a Slack or email notification to your team, and halts the task safely so it can be re-run manually once the API is online.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Do we need to pay for automation licenses?',
			a: 'We build workflows using open-source platforms like n8n or Python scripts hosted on your own servers. This means you do not have to pay licensing fees to us, and you only pay direct utility costs to your cloud provider.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Where do we see a list of automated workflows currently running?',
			a: 'We configure a unified runtime dashboard. Your team can log in to view execution history, success rates, processing logs, and active queue states at any time.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Can you automate legacy systems that do not have an API?',
			a: 'Yes. In cases where legacy software lacks API access, we construct browser automation scripts (using Puppeteer or Selenium) that log in, navigate pages, and submit forms exactly like a human user would.',
