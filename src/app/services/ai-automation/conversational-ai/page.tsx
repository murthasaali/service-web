	faqs: [
		{
			q: 'How is this different from a basic chatbot or FAQ widget?',
			a: 'A basic chatbot follows a rigid decision tree and fails as soon as a user phrases something outside the script. AI assistants understand natural language, draw from a living knowledge base, and handle variations in how a question is asked. They also connect to live data sources for dynamic answers rather than returning static content.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Can the AI access our live system data such as order status or appointment availability?',
			a: 'Yes. We build API connectors between the AI assistant and your order management, CRM, or booking systems. The AI calls these APIs at query time to return real-time data specific to the customer asking.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How do you handle questions the AI cannot answer?',
			a: 'We configure structured escalation rules. When the AI confidence falls below a threshold, or when a user explicitly requests a human, the conversation is routed to your support team with full context so the agent can pick up without the customer needing to repeat themselves.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Will the AI understand our industry-specific terminology?',
			a: 'Yes. We configure the prompt system and knowledge base with your specific terminology, product names, and internal language. For highly specialized domains, we also use retrieval-augmented generation from your technical documentation so answers reflect your actual processes.',
