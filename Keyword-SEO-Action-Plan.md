## Executive Summary

### What the CSV Tells Us

The Google Ads CSV (1,028 rows) is **90%+ project management / construction software keywords** (Procore, site management, contractor scheduling). These are irrelevant to aibizmod. However, two keyword patterns inside the CSV signal a massive trending opportunity:

| Keyword | Monthly Volume (India) | YoY Change | Why It Matters for aibizmod |
|---|---|---|---|
| cloud based project management software | 5,000 | **+9,900%** | aibizmod builds this type of software |
| cloud project management software | 5,000 | **+9,900%** | Same — custom SaaS PM systems |
| cloud based project management tools | 500 | **+9,900%** | Blog / comparison content |
| cloud project management tools | 500 | **+9,900%** | Blog / comparison content |
| it project management software | 500 | 0% | IT Consulting page |
| engineering project management software | 500 | 0% | Industry-Specific Software page |
| software management tools | 500 | 0% | Business Applications page |
| project management tools for software dev | 50 | **+900%** | Blog target |
| it project management tools | 50 | 0% | IT Consulting page |

**The signal:** Cloud-based software solutions are surging at +9,900% YoY. The site is not positioned to capture any of this.

### What 2026 Trends Add (Beyond the CSV)

The CSV was researched for a construction niche. For aibizmod's actual services, these are the 2026 keyword opportunities ranked by intent + volume:

| Cluster | Top Trending Keywords | Search Intent |
|---|---|---|
| AI & Automation | ai automation services, ai workflow automation, generative ai for business, llm integration services, ai chatbot development | Commercial investigation |
| Custom Software | custom software development company, bespoke software development, saas development company, erp software development | Commercial investigation |
| Web Development | custom web application development, next.js development company, web app development agency | Commercial investigation |
| Digital Marketing | seo services, geo optimization, generative engine optimization, ai seo services | Commercial investigation |
| IT Consulting | it consulting services uk, digital transformation consulting, managed it services, fractional cto services | Commercial investigation |
| Mobile Apps | mobile app development company, flutter app development, react native development agency | Commercial investigation |
| Cloud Hosting | managed cloud hosting, cloud migration services, aws managed services, devops services | Commercial investigation |

## Section 1 — Slug Changes

> **Warning:** Slug changes break existing URLs. Implement **301 redirects** for every change, or skip for now and only update titles/descriptions. Slugs marked `CRITICAL` have abbreviated or unclear terms that hurt crawlability and ranking. Slugs marked `OPTIONAL` are fine but could be improved.

### Parent-Level Slug Changes

| Current Slug | New Slug | Priority | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/services/automation` | `/services/ai-automation` | **CRITICAL** | "Automation" alone does not capture the high-value "AI automation services" keyword cluster. AI is the primary differentiator. |
| `/services/customer-exp-management` | `/services/customer-experience-management` | **CRITICAL** | Abbreviated slug harms crawlability. Google prefers natural keyword phrases. All sub-page URLs also need to update. |
| `/services/hosting-infrastructure` | `/services/cloud-hosting-infrastructure` | OPTIONAL | Adding "cloud" captures the +9,900% cloud keyword trend. Only do this if willing to manage 301s. |

### Sub-Page Slug Changes

| Current URL | New Slug | Priority | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/services/software-development/it-consulting-services` | `tech-advisory-services` | **CRITICAL** | Confusingly mirrors the `/it-consulting-it-services` parent. Cannibalises that page. Rename to `tech-advisory-services`. |
| `/services/automation/ai-intelligence` | `ai-analytics` | OPTIONAL | "AI Intelligence" is not a search phrase. "AI analytics" and "predictive analytics" have real search volume. |
| `/services/hosting-infrastructure/security` | `infrastructure-security` | OPTIONAL | "Security" is a single-word slug in a subfolder — too generic. |

### 301 Redirect Template (add to `next.config.js`)

```js
// next.config.js
async redirects() {
  return [
    { source: '/services/automation/:path*', destination: '/services/ai-automation/:path*', permanent: true },
    { source: '/services/customer-exp-management/:path*', destination: '/services/customer-experience-management/:path*', permanent: true },
    { source: '/services/software-development/it-consulting-services', destination: '/services/software-development/tech-advisory-services', permanent: true },
  ]
}
```

## Section 4 — H1 Alignment

The H1 on each service page is currently the `data.name` field. These must match the primary keyword in the title tag. With the title changes above, update `data.name` on the following pages:

| File | Current `data.name` | New `data.name` |
|---|---|---|
| `automation/page.tsx` | `"Automation"` | `"AI Automation"` |
| `automation/ai-intelligence/page.tsx` | `"AI Intelligence"` | `"AI Analytics & Predictive Intelligence"` |

## Section 5 — Homepage (`src/app/page.tsx` + `src/app/layout.tsx`)

### Homepage title

```ts
// src/app/page.tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "aibizmod | AI Automation, Software & Digital Services | UK & India",
  description:
    "aibizmod delivers AI automation, custom software development, web development, mobile apps, cloud hosting, IT consulting, and digital marketing for businesses in the UK and India.",
}
```

### Root layout keywords (src/app/layout.tsx)

Replace the generic keywords array:

```ts
// CURRENT — remove these:
keywords: ['tech services', 'web development', 'mobile apps', 'cloud', 'automation', 'digital marketing']

// REPLACE WITH:
keywords: [
  'ai automation services',
  'custom software development',
  'web development company',
  'mobile app development',
  'cloud hosting services',
  'it consulting services',
  'digital marketing agency',
  'business process automation',
  'digital transformation consulting',
  'saas development company',
  'generative ai services',
  'managed it services',
]
```

### H1 (HeroSection) — NOT a keyword change, but flag for content team

Current H1: **"Technology That Keeps Business Connected"**  
Recommended: Consider a version that surfaces a primary keyword, e.g.  
`"AI Automation & Digital Services for Growing Businesses"` — but only if the design accommodates it. H1 carries ranking weight.

### Fix locale mismatch

```ts
// src/app/layout.tsx
// Current — wrong for India targeting:
locale: 'en_GB'

// Change to (if targeting both UK + India):
locale: 'en'
// Or keep en_GB if UK is the primary market and India is secondary
```
